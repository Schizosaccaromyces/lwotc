## 1.0 beta 4.1 changes (from beta 4)

This is mostly a bug fix release - changes listed below.

### New Features

 * Gatecrasher now guarantees an officer corpse on top of the one you can get from the officer in the mission
   - This should help newcomers that would otherwise get stuck on lasers because they didn't realise the importance of the corpse and blew the unit up on Gatecrasher
 * The Render Officer Corpse research option is now only available once you have finished the autopsy for it; this ensures that players don't accidentally render the corpse before the autopsy, which would otherwise block mag weapon research
 * You can now view the details of locked abilities in the promotion screen

### Bug fixes

 * Soldiers that are left on Ambush missions bleeding out will now die rather than reappearing on the Avenger in the soldier roster
 * Ambush missions in the wilderness will no longer have blank areas on the map (hopefully)
 * Coilgun's bonus shred no longer applies to secondaries or other non-primary weapons
 * One For All now gets the correct ablative bonus for tier-2 and tier-3 shields
 * Overcharge no longer stacks with itself or permanently increases the Templar's Aim
 * The Ballistic Shields mod should now work with LWOTC (mainly fixes issues with soldier classes that depend on the mod)
 * Skirmishers will no longer get a blank tier-4 XCOM-row ability
 * Sharpshooter's holotargeter visual effects now work
 * Pistol abilities will no longer apply to secondary weapons if a soldier does not have a pistol equipped
  - The abilities will simply not show in the soldier's ability bar if no pistol or sidearm is equipped
 * The first tutorial box on Gatecrasher should no longer show errors on non-English installations; it will currently show the English text until translations are provided
 * The Russian LWOTC second wave options will now appear correctly (they were garbled before)

We hope you enjoy the mod, and good luck commanders!
