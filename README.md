## Installing and playing the mod

that explains how it works.

## Building and running the mod

If you want to contribute changes to code or assets, then you will need to
build the mod so that you can test them. Before you can do that, you need to
set some things up:

 1. Make sure you have the WOTC SDK `full_content` branch installed - see the
    [xcom2mods wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/xcom2mods/wiki/index#wiki_setting_up_tools_for_modding)
    for details on how to do that (plus lots of other useful information)

 2. [Fork this repository](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo)
    and then clone your fork locally, which you can do via [Git for Windows](https://gitforwindows.org/)
    (a command-line tool), [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/), or some other
    git client tool

 3. Once you have cloned the repository, you may need to pull the code for the embedded
    highlander. If the *X2WOTCCommunityHighlander* directory is empty, then use the
    command line from the project's root directory (the one containing this README.md):
    ```
        > git submodule update --init
    ```
    or whatever is the equivalent with the git client tool you are using.

 4. Download the LWOTC media assets (video, graphics and sound) from
    [this Dropbox link](https://www.dropbox.com/s/209rybpdl3khb26/lwotc-content.zip?dl=0)
    and unpack the resulting zip file into this project's *LongWarOfTheChosen* directory.

 5. Set up the following environment variables:
    * `XCOM2SDKPATH` — typically &lt;path to Steam&gt;\steamapps\common\XCOM 2 War Of The Chosen SDK
    * `XCOM2GAMEPATH` — typically &lt;path to Steam&gt;\steamapps\common\XCOM 2\XCom2-WarOfTheChosen
    Don't put these paths in quotes.
	
 6. Open a new command prompt after setting those environment variables and run
    the following from the LWOTC project directory:
    ```
    > build-lwotc.bat -config default
    ```
    (You can specify `-config debug` to compile with debug info)
 
 7. You should also build the Community Highlander, which you can do by opening
    the solution file in X2WOTCCommunityHighlander in Mod Buddy and using that
    to build the project, or you can open the LWOTC project directory in VS Code
    and use the "Terminal > Run Task..." menu option and select "Build CHL
    (final release)" and then "Build DLC2 CHL" once the previous task has finished.

Once the highlander and LWOTC are built, you will be able to select them as local
mods in Alternative Mod Launcher and run Long War of the Chosen.
